Welcome to the Attacking and Defending Azure Kubernetes Service Clusters.  This is inspired by [Secure Kubernetes](https://securekubernetes.com/), as [presented at KubeCon NA 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdMFTdeAL1s). We'll help you create your own AKS so you can follow along as we take on the role of two attacking personas looking to make some money and one defending persona working hard to keep the cluster safe and healthy.
